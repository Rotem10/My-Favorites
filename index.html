      This animated science fiction show is both funny and profound at the same
      time, which is what I love about it.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith
      household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer
      and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a
      guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle,
      Washington. The adventures of Rick and Morty, however, take place across
      an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to other
      planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying saucer. Rick is
      an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary
      conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes
      on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but
      easily distressed boy, whose naïve but grounded moral compass plays
      counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister,
      Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her
      status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their
      adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and
      assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her
      professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her
      marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of
      Rick's influence over his family. Different versions of the characters
      inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their
      personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's
      original Rick identifies himself as "Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension
      C-137", in reference to his original universe, but this does not apply to
      any other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season
      episode "Rick Potion #9", after turning the entire world population into
      monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different dimension, leaving the
      original Summer, Beth and Jerry behind. Rick and Morty themselves also
      hail from different dimensions; the season 5 finale "Rickmurai Jack" shows
      that the original Rick's original family was murdered by an alternate
      version of himself, with the season 6 premiere "Solaricks" revealing that
      this alternate Rick is Morty's biological grandfather instead of the one
      the show focuses on.

    <h3>My Favorite Quote</h3>
    <p>
      “To live is to risk it all; otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of
      randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you…”
    </p>
    <h3>Rick’s Catchphrase</h3>
    <p>
      “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!” (In Birdperson’s language, the phrase means, “I am
      in great pain, please help me.”)

      This park has a calming vibe and I enjoy watching the ducks swim in the
      pond.
