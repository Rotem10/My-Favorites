    <p>
      This animated science fiction show is both funny and profound at the same
      time, which is what I love about it.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith
      household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer
      and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a
      guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle,
      Washington.[4] The adventures of Rick and Morty, however, take place
      across an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to
      other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying saucer.[5]
      Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many
      ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He
      frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a
      kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na√Øve but grounded moral
      compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's
      17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries
      about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and
      Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally
      level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though
      self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is
      dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure
      person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Different
      versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's
      multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to
      another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as "Rick Sanchez of
      Earth Dimension C-137", in reference to his original universe, but this
      does not apply to any other member of the Smith household. For instance,
      in the first-season episode "Rick Potion #9", after turning the entire
      world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different
      dimension, leaving the original Summer, Beth and Jerry behind. Rick and
      Morty themselves also hail from different dimensions; the season 5 finale
      "Rickmurai Jack" shows that the original Rick's original family was
      murdered by an alternate version of himself, with the season 6 premiere
      "Solaricks" revealing that this alternate Rick is Morty's biological
      grandfather instead of the one the show focuses on.
